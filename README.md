things to do:

1. create something that allows user to interactively use the program with a GUI
2. create something for collecting sudoku data -- a scraper that reads from somewhere and stores sudoku strongs in our format
3. solver 1: use simple logic to create a state space model --> for each empty space, we look at all possible elements
